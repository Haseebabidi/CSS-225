from math import pi  # this command will import the value or thr pi. professor i can also add manully.

radius = int(input("enter the radius of the circle: "))  # Ask the user to input the radius of the circle and convert it to an integer


print(pi * radius ** 2)  # this basically multiply the value of pi with radus power 2. "pi*radius^2"
